# 🛡️ UPI Fraud Shield ML
### Intelligent UPI Fraud Detection System Using Machine Learning

UPI Fraud Shield ML is an end-to-end Machine Learning-powered web application designed to identify potentially fraudulent UPI transactions using behavioral, transactional, authentication, and account-level features.

The system leverages multiple Machine Learning algorithms, Explainable AI (SHAP), interactive dashboards, and model evaluation techniques to provide real-time fraud risk assessment and transparent predictions.

## 🚀 Project Overview

With the rapid growth of digital payments, fraudulent transactions have become a major concern for users and financial institutions. Traditional rule-based fraud detection systems struggle to identify sophisticated and evolving fraud patterns.

UPI Fraud Shield ML addresses this challenge by:

- Detecting suspicious transactions using Machine Learning
- Calculating fraud probability scores
- Providing explainable predictions using SHAP
- Comparing multiple machine learning models
- Visualizing model performance and insights
- Maintaining prediction history for analysis
